Hi {{first_name}}, I'm contacting you about a problem I have with sending a wire transfer using this IBAN {{iban}}
She was born on {{date_of_birth}}. Her maiden name is {{last_name}}

Just posted a photo {{url}}
My website is {{url}}

Have you been to a {{person}} concert before?
I'm so jealous! said {{first_name}} to {{first_name}}
The true gender of {{first_name}} has been under debate for years, but the riff and building energy is a rock masterpiece regardless.
For my take on {{prefix_female}} {{last_name_female}}, see Guilty Pleasures: 5 Musicians Of The 70s You're Supposed To Hate (But Secretly Love)
Unlike the {{last_name}} novel, it's not about necrophilia. What it is about, I suppose is anyone's guess. A brilliant piece of baroque pop.
One of the most depressing songs on the list. He's injured from the waist down from {{country}}, but {{first_name}} just has to get laid. Don't go to town, {{first_name}}!
Is there a better crafted pop song on this list? {{last_name}} and {{last_name}} were precision engineers.

{{name_male}} listed his top 20 songs for Entertainment Weekly and had the balls to list this song at #15. (What did he put at #1 you ask? Answer:Tube Snake Boogie by {{person}} – go figure)
From the film {{nationality}} graffiti (also features {{person}}. What's not to love?
You can tell {{first_name}} was a huge {{person}} fan. Written when he was {{age}}.
This song by ex-Zombie {{last_name}} is a perfect example of why you shouldn't concentrate on the order of this list. An argument could be made that this should be at number one, and I wouldn't argue with it.
The title refers to {{street_name}} street in {{city}}. It was on this street that many of the clubs where Metallica first played were situated.

Blink-182 pay tribute here to the {{country}}. Producer {{person}} explained to Fuse TV: We all liked the idea of writing a song about our state, where we live and love.

It may be too that {{last_name}} was influenced by an earlier song, Carry Me Back To {{country}}, which was arranged and sung by {{person}} in {{year}} (though {{last_name}}'s song was actually about a boat!).
